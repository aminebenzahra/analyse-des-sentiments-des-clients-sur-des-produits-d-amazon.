I've used 2 types of vectorizers that are count vectorizer and tf-idf and 2 models for every type and then made a comparaison between their results:

for count vectorizer's method:

Results for Logistic Regression with CountVectorizer 90.12% accuracy

Results for Support Vector Machine with CountVectorizer 88.28% accuracy

Results for Logistic Regression with tfidf 89,89% accuracy

Results for Support Vector Machine with tfidf 89,94% accuracy

tf-idf vectorizer seems to be slightly better than count vectorizer in this project
